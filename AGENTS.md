Guidance for AI coding agents working in this repository.

## Project overview

The eve retro game factory: Foreman, an orchestrator agent built on the [eve](https://eve.dev) framework that turns a single chat prompt into a draft pull request adding a thin, browser-only 2D retro game on the configured repository (`FACTORY_REPO`). Work arrives only from the default eve chat channel. The orchestrator checks feasibility, writes a one-page game brief (handoff artifact kind `game-brief`), then moves the item through two declared subagent stations in order: **implementer** (scaffolds `games/<slug>/` from `_template`, codes, verifies, pushes `factory/game-<slug>`) → **player** (independent playtest on the pushed branch via `pnpm playtest`, different model vendor, max 2 revision cycles). The orchestrator then opens a draft PR whose body includes the brief summary, playtest checks, screenshot paths, and a preview URL placeholder. Marking the PR ready parks on human approval; merging is not in the tool surface. Per-user preferences live in **Vercel Blob**, alongside a shared, per-repo **factory brain** under a reserved Blob prefix, readable by every run but writable only by trusted callers (chat stays untrusted by default so writes park on approval), and **handoff artifacts** under the reserved `artifacts/` prefix (`game-brief`, `playtest-report`). The pipeline lives in `agent/instructions.ts`.

The whole agent is defined under `agent/`. eve discovers capabilities from the filesystem. See [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./.github/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the component map, data flow, trust model, and boundaries.

## Setup & commands

```bash
pnpm install        # install dependencies (Node 24.x)
pnpm exec playwright install chromium  # browser binary for playtests
pnpm dev            # eve dev — local TUI; run /model once to link a model provider
pnpm typecheck      # tsc for agent + games/_kit + _template + _playtest
pnpm check          # ultracite (Biome) lint + format check
pnpm fix            # ultracite (Biome) auto-fix
pnpm build          # eve build (agent)
pnpm build:games    # Vite-build every game into games/dist/<slug>/
pnpm test           # Vitest
pnpm playtest <slug> [--genre platformer|shmup|arcade|puzzle]
pnpm new-game <slug>
pnpm eval           # eve eval — run the evals suite (see tags below; costs real tokens)
eve deploy          # deploy to Vercel production (use this, not raw `vercel deploy`)
npx eve info        # print the discovered surface + discovery diagnostics
pnpm validate       # check + typecheck + eve info in one command
```

**Verify changes with `pnpm validate` (lint, typecheck, and discovery diagnostics must all report 0 errors / 0 warnings), then exercise the agent in the `pnpm dev` TUI.** The evals suite (`pnpm eval --tag fast`) guards routing and safety behavior; `pnpm eval pipeline/full-pipeline` runs the whole line and pushes a real branch, so run it deliberately and against a scratch repo.

## eve conventions

- **Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/eve/docs/` before writing code.** Don't invent framework APIs; confirm them against the docs.
- **Identity comes from the filesystem, never a `name` field.** A tool at `agent/tools/agent.ts` is the tool `agent`; a subagent directory `agent/subagents/implementer/` lowers into the tool `implementer`.
- Authored slots: `agent/agent.ts` (model + session budget), `agent/instructions.ts` (`defineInstructions`, the orchestrator prompt; resolved at build time, injecting `FACTORY_REPO`), `agent/tools/*.ts` (`defineTool`), `agent/extensions/*.ts`, `agent/channels/*.ts`, `agent/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, `agent/subagents/<id>/agent.ts` (`defineAgent`), per-agent `sandbox.ts`.
- **Model assignments are centralized** in `agent/lib/models.ts` (the `MODELS` map). Every `agent.ts` reads its entry from there (`model: MODELS.<agent>`) instead of hardcoding a gateway id, so a model swap is a one-line edit in that file. One split is deliberate: `implementer` runs the strongest coding model on a different vendor than `player`, so the playtest stays independent; keep those two on different vendors.
- **Extensions:** `agent/extensions/<ns>.ts` mounts a prebuilt eve extension; the filename is the namespace and its tools appear to the model as `<ns>__<tool>` (here: `github__*` from `@github-tools/eve-extension`). Config keys (`include`, `requireApproval`) use bare tool names.
- **Channels:** only `eve` (route-auth channel for chat, reached from the web chat UI, the dev TUI, or any HTTP client). No other channels are mounted. The github extension remains on the root for opening draft PRs; approvals park on chat.
- **Subagents are the stations.** Declared under `agent/subagents/<id>/`; `description` is required (the routing hint) and each station's `agent.ts` also declares an `outputSchema`, which makes every delegation run in **task mode**: structured output, no parking. A declared subagent runs in a fresh child session and **inherits nothing** from the root (no instructions, skills, connections, tools, or sandbox), so the orchestrator packs everything into the `message`, and any capability a station needs lives in the station's own directory (its `sandbox.ts`, its `tools/`). Long documents travel between stations as **handoff artifacts**: the orchestrator saves the game brief with `save_artifact`, stations open it with `read_artifact`, and the orchestrator relays only the id (the factories live in `agent/lib/artifacts/`).
- **Approval-gated tools must not live in task-mode children.** A task-mode session cannot park, so a station tool that returned `user-approval` would strand the run. Anything needing approval belongs on the root (the `github` extension and `update_factory_brain`); station side effects must be inert by construction, like `push_branch` (feature branches only, validated names, brokered credential).
- **`agent/lib/trust.ts` is the single trust authority.** The eve chat channel leaves callers untrusted by default so reversible writes and brain updates park on chat approval cards; draft PRs still run without a card. Approval policies in `agent/lib/github/approval.ts` read the stamps and return `not-applicable` / `user-approval` / `denied`. A new capability never invents its own caller check; gate on the existing predicates.
- **Station sandboxes** share their bootstrap/session logic via `agent/lib/github/repo-sandbox.ts`: the clone and `FACTORY_SETUP_COMMAND` run once per template build, sessions pay a fetch. Every sandbox (root included) passes the shared `FACTORY_SANDBOX_CREATE_OPTIONS` from that module to `vercel(...)`: one kept snapshot and a 14-day expiration, so template snapshots survive quiet stretches without accumulating. Git operations always target the literal remote URL (never `origin`) with the token injected at the sandbox firewall.
- **Tools** run in the app runtime (full `process.env`), one default export per file; station git and playtest tools run their commands in the station's sandbox via `ctx.getSandbox()`. Gate destructive root tools with `approval` from `eve/tools/approval` (here: `clear_user_preferences`), or with a trust policy from `agent/lib/github/approval.ts` when the gate depends on the caller (here: `update_factory_brain`, gated by `factoryBrainPolicy`).
- **Skills** are load-on-demand. A packaged skill (`<name>/SKILL.md`) requires `description` frontmatter; that description is the routing hint. Root skills: `retro-design`, `writing-quality`. Implementer: `retro-stack`, `pixel-assets`. Player: `game-smoke`, `retro-design`. Skills are per-agent: stations don't see the root's skills.
- **Evals** live in `evals/` (`defineEval`, one file per case; `evals.config.ts` sets the judge model). Category directories are the failure taxonomy (`routing/`, `safety/`, `pipeline/`); `helpers.ts` carries the shared write-tool list so read-only evals assert deny-by-default (`notCalledTool` over the whole list). Tags: `fast` (cheap loop), `slow`, `needs-connect` (asserts calls that must succeed against real Connect auth), `pipeline` (pushes a real branch; opt-in).
- After editing, **check LSP diagnostics / `pnpm typecheck`** and fix type errors before moving on.

## Code style

- Linting and formatting are handled by **Ultracite** (a Biome preset). Run `pnpm check` before finishing and `pnpm fix` to auto-fix. Config is in `biome.jsonc`; the kebab-case filename rule is disabled there because eve tools use snake_case names.
- TypeScript strict; ESM with `NodeNext` resolution (relative imports need a `.js` extension). Prefer `const`, arrow functions, optional chaining / nullish coalescing.
- Validate tool input/output with `zod` schemas.
- Prose in markdown files is not hard-wrapped: write each paragraph or bullet as one line.
- Agent-facing text (instructions, skill bodies, tool and subagent descriptions) follows the "How you write" rules in `agent/instructions.ts`: no em dashes, no machine-made words, no bold for emphasis. It carries behavior only, never framework plumbing (how approvals render, sign-in flows) or references to tools and skills the reading agent can't access — station instructions especially, since stations see none of the root's surface.

## Security

- **Never ask the user for API keys, client secrets, or any other credentials.**
- **Never commit secrets.** `.env*` is gitignored. Connector UIDs are read from env (`GITHUB_CONNECTOR`); GitHub auth is brokered by Vercel Connect (tokens resolved per call, never exposed to the model) and Blob auth is via the project's OIDC token. `FACTORY_REPO` is required at module load (`requireEnv`), so a missing value fails discovery; `FACTORY_SETUP_COMMAND` is optional.
- **Git safety is structural; keep it that way.** Sandbox git always targets the literal `https://github.com/<FACTORY_REPO>.git` URL, never `origin` (remote config in a sandbox is model-writable), with the installation token injected at the sandbox firewall (`brokerPolicy`) so it never enters the sandbox. Everything interpolated into a git command passes `validateBranch`, which also refuses `main`/`master`. Don't weaken these when adding git capabilities.
- **Respect the trust model.** Trust is stamped at dispatch by channels; chat does not stamp trusted by default, so reversible writes park for the person on the other end of chat. When adding a tool, pick its policy from `agent/lib/github/approval.ts` (or the trust predicates) instead of hardcoding `"never"`.
- If you ever build a `RegExp` from data, escape it (literal match) and bound the input length.
- Gate irreversible or high-impact actions behind `approval` (here: `clear_user_preferences`, plus the ship-gate policies on the GitHub extension).
- Every reserved Blob prefix is declared in the namespace registry in `agent/lib/blob.ts`, alongside the shared read/write/delete document helpers all Blob tools go through. Any general-purpose Blob tool added later must consult the registry's guards before acting, so a managed document can't be reached through a generic file operation; add a namespace there, never as a loose constant in a feature module.
- For per-user storage, derive the key from the resolved principal (`ctx.session.auth.current`), never from model input — see `agent/lib/user-preferences.ts`. The preference files live under the reserved `user-preferences/` Blob prefix, reachable only through the principal-scoped preference tools.
- The shared **factory brain** derives its key from `FACTORY_REPO`, never from model input or a caller principal — see `agent/lib/factory-brain.ts`. It lives under the reserved `factory-brain/` Blob prefix, reachable only through `read_factory_brain` / `update_factory_brain`; writes are gated by `factoryBrainPolicy` (unattended runs denied, trusted callers direct, everyone else parks).
- **Handoff artifacts** live under the reserved `artifacts/` Blob prefix, reachable only through `save_artifact` / `read_artifact` — see `agent/lib/artifacts/config.ts`. Ids are model-supplied on read, so every id must pass the anchored `ARTIFACT_ID_PATTERN` (no dots or slashes) before it is interpolated into a Blob key; that is what keeps a station from addressing the brain or a preference file through the artifact tools. Saves never overwrite and are size-bounded, which keeps both tools inert enough to live in task-mode stations without approval.

## Before committing

- `pnpm validate` passes (Ultracite check, `tsc`, and `eve info` with 0 errors / 0 warnings).
- No secrets, `node_modules`, or build output (`.eve`, `.vercel`, `.output`) staged.

## Games factory target (`games/`)

Browser-only retro games live under `games/`. Shared kit package is `@games/kit` (`games/_kit`). Harness is `games/_playtest`. Template is `games/_template`. Site package is `games/_site`. Build output is `games/dist/`. See `games/README.md` and `games/AGENTS.md`.

Root scripts: `pnpm build:games`, `pnpm playtest <slug>`, `pnpm new-game <slug>`, `pnpm test`. Workspace packages: `games/_kit`, `games/_playtest`, `games/_site`, `games/*`, excluding `games/dist`. Kaplay is pinned on the 4000 alpha line used by the kit. Title scenes must expose `window.__startGame` for headless starts; seam uses rAF; camera uses `setCamPos`.
